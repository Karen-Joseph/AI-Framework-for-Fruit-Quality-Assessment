# AI-Framework-for-Fruit-Quality-Assessment
 The AI utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNNs) combined with Large Language Models (LLMs) to 
deliver complete fruit-quality evaluation which includes 
spoilage detection and price assessment. Through deep 
learning image analysis the system identifies different 
ripeness stages of fruits at high speed which results in fast 
spoiled produce detection. The efficiency of the system 
increases because of LLM functionalities that deliver 
important product shelf life instructions while supplying 
preservation methods and proper usage guidelines. The price 
calculation system employs data-driven rules to measure 
product worth based on ripeness indicators which creates 
balanced pricing structure for suppliers and customers. A 
coalition of advanced evaluation methods and AI automation 
systems generates optimal fruit quality testing which 
enhances market evaluations and retail point-of-sale 
assessments. The proposed method enables both precise and 
efficient fruit classification as well as promotes sustainable 
consumption through waste reduction to enhance buying 
choices.
